Overall Look and Feel of Gotta Go
===============================

Gotta Go has a more modern aesthetic. The website will look and feel minimalist and flat. Buttons should be 2D, the page content should be clean, and the layout elegant.

The website should be calm and gentle for the user, much like they will be after using our service.
