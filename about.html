				<h2>Gotta Go</h2>
				<p>Gotta Go is a startup company eliminating the major problem of always
                    ending up in terrible restrooms. We solved that problem by creating
                    an app that lets our dedicated users contribute to the community by
                    reviewing the restrooms they go to. Much like Google Reviews, this
                    allows others to know the quality of the restroom without actually
                    being there. This saves everyone time and effort. Our approach gave
                    our users a streamlined experience in finding the best and nearest
                    restrooms around.
