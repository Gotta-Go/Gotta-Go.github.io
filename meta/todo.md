# Task list



## Urgent
* create 'final' site design in Photoshop before implimentation


## Important
* javascript implimentation?
* furnish __EACH__ site page with relevent *and* well-designed content
* finalize typography
* logo redesign: change logo to just a blue circle with white shine dot (so that the shape is more uniform / not elongated)? if true, shorten height of navigation bar
* create icon art/graphic design
* grand, fitting images at the top head


## Normal
* lessen spacing between play store and app store column (rededucing percentage in column_double class does not work?)
* add play and app store links (go to their main website)
* add signin button (goes to nothing or something else)
* add feature for bathroom types (male, female, unisex, disabled, family)
* add feature on toilet paper reliability rating
* have a different banner image on each page?
* index ("we've got you covered"): adjust values, left align, bullet points(?), icons, JS counter(?)
* JS: interactive scrolling (ex. near the bottom of the [app store](https://www.apple.com/ca/ios/app-store/) or an [article](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-16/north-korea-missile-range-map/8880894))


## Low
* add padding/space under the 'available now' play/app store buttons
fill in footer with more information (see [apple's website](apple.com/ca/))
* add contact email form
* add better page resizing (the width:80% restricts the page and cuts off images when it becomes small?)
* add page icon (appears in the browser tab)
