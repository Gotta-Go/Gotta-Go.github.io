		<h2>Location Finder <img src="Location_pin.png" alt="Location Pin" align="bottom"></h2>
		<p>When looking for bathrooms you can use one of two search methods:

		<h3>Around Me</h3>
		<p>Searches automatically for bathrooms near to the location indicated by your device's location services.</p>
		
		<h3>Map Browser</h3>
		<p>Lets you look for bathrooms on an interactive map—useful whether you want to plan ahead or you just have some time to kill!</p>

		<h2>Rating System <img src="Rating_star.png" alt="Star" align="bottom"></h2>
		<p>Our rating system allows other users to rate the quality of bathrooms they have visited, making sure you only need to visit the best places around!</p>
		<p>The average rating of each bathroom will be displayed either when located on the map, or when listed by our automatic search.</p>

		<h2>Priority Searching <img src="checklist.png" alt="Checklist" align="bottom"></h2>
		<p>If you wish, you can set a priority for your bathroom searches:</p>
		
		<h3>Top Rated</h3>
		<p>Filters out poorly rated bathrooms, favoring better bathrooms above poorer quality ones, even if that means sending you further.</p>

		<h3>Closest to Me</h3>
		<p>Sorts the bathrooms by distance, rather than rating. Only recommended for those in a hurry!</p>
